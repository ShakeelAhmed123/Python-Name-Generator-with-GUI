# Python-Name-Generator-with-GUI
Takes 2 random names from a file of names and make a new name using them.(Last 4 and first 4 digits of both)

NAMES CANNOT BE SHORTER THAN 3 CHARACTERS!

Make sure you have you pre-existing names in a text file, in this particular order

After doing this you will see your names in the app. If you don't then there is something wrong with the file, or the format.

After that, set the time, below the Generate button, the timer determines how many seconds the script will run. (The longer the time, the more the name).

Then wait for the given time period, the program will freeze for the time given.

Then you will see all generated names.

Click Remove Duplicates to remove all the duplicate names.

Then finally export all names to another file.

Here is how it looks:
